# My-Projects

Elixir/Erlang: There are two project under the hood. One is the Card game and another app called as Identicon.
               Both are built using Elixir/Erlang , a new functional programming language which i explored recently.
               The cards app creates a deck of cards, shuffles it, creates a deal and saves it to a file.
               
               The Identicon app is the default image producing app which will create a unique image for a particular string .
               It will produce the same image for the particular string irrespective of the number of times its invoked.
               This app uses many built in functions and data structures of Elixir/Erlang.
